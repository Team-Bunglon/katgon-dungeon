### Description
Katgon Dungeon is a topdown puzzle game that revolves around controlling a pair of explorers. Instead of one character, you play as two characters with distinct special move and property that help them interact with certain element in the dungeon. Switch to either one of them at anytime or split them up to handle different routes separately and take advantage of the synergy between the two to clear out the dungeon's hardest challenge and reach the end!

Inspired by many topdown puzzle game such as The Legend of Zelda and Avatar: The Legend of Aang on GBA.

- C: Switch leader
- V: Manually split from your partner, then take control of either Kat or Gon with Z or X

### Plot
The golden dragon fruit is one of the most valuable and delicious fruit that's highly sought after around the world. Due to its rarity, many have searched for the existence of the legendary fruit and only few have managed to acquire one. While obtaining one doesn't necessarily make you a millionaire overnight, one is valuable enough for a comfortable life for a long time.

Kat and Gon, a pair of well-known explorers around the local area, discover an ancient dungeon that holds one golden dragon fruit in its deepest area. However, due to its extremely intricate puzzle, nobody has managed to reach the end of the dungeon. As the duo are facing a difficult financial situation lately, they have no other choice but to tackle the dungeon on their own. With the two sharing a strong bond of partnership together, there is nothing they can't do...

# Characters
### Kat
Katherine the Cat, Kat for short, is an energetic cat who has a lust for adventure. Formerly a member of a disbanded exploration syndicate, she knows many tricks up her fur sleeves for a successful dungeon exploration. She also has an unusual strength when it comes to her punch as she can pound the ground strong enough to cause a shock wave as well as thick fur that protects her from extreme cold. She has a dream of living under a comfortable wealth along with Gon, her partner and best friend.

### Gon
Gonfred the Dragon, Gon for short, is an easy-going Dragon who follows Kat wherever she goes. He has become Kat's loyal friend ever since he ended his brief rivaly with Kat during their time at the exploration syndicate. He has a powerful punch that can break the hardest rock out there as well as a specialized organ to shoot fireball out of his mouth and a skin strong enough for a total immunity to fire. As long as he can find himself an inner piece, he has no problem acting like Kat's personal sidekick.

# Colectibles
### Golden Dragon Fruit
The dungeon holds one of them at its deepest chamber. However, It is guarded by many puzzles that require specialized skill set to solve. Nobody knew who built the dungeon and laid out those puzzle inside and where the golden dragon fruit originally came from. But one thing for sure is that it's not an easy task to get one in your hand.

### Golden Cherries:
Another rare and expensive fruit that's not as valuable as the golden dragon fruit but can be found more commonly. While it is not required to obtain even one of them, one can still be sold for a good price in the right hand. There are 8 of them scattered throughout the dungeon. Can you get them all?

# Obstacles
Destructible:
- Twig: An overgrown root around the dungeon's floor that requires Kat's sharp claw (or ground pound) in order to be cleared.
- Boulder: A giant boulder that requires extreme force to break through. Luckily, Gon's fist will do the job.
- Ash: A hardened version of the twig that can't easily be destroyed using physical force. However, it is very susceptible to any fire sources.

Buttons:
- Red button: Your usual button. Nothing more, nothing less.
- Yellow button: Hit again to deactivate it.
- Grey button: Requires direct hit to be activated (special moves won't do a thing).
- Torch: Requires a fire source to lit it up
- Pawpad: Only someone with paw can push it. Pushing one pawpad will raise another pushed pawpad in the room.

Spikes:
- Spike tile: A pesky tile that prevent anyone from moving across when it is raised. Find a button or anything equivalent to retract it.
- Flame tile: A tile that blows out blazing flames which can burn any flammable object, such as mammalian furs, in its path. However, Gon's scale is strong enough to protect him from the extreme heat. 
- Frostfire tile: A tile that bursts out bitter frostfires which can freeze any freezable object, such as reptilian scales, in its path. However, Kat's fur is thick enough to protect her from the extreme cold.
